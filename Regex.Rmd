```{r}
Mdata <-read.csv("Data1/measurements.csv")

#Use a dplyr command AND regular expressions to add a new column called Sp that modifies the Species names with only the first letter and period.
```{r}
Mdata<-Mdata%>%mutate(Sp = sub("(\\w)(\\w+)","\\1\\.", Species));Mdata 
```

#Use a dplyr command to create a new dataset BUT with Sp column instead of the Species column, moved to the beginning in place of the original Species column.

```{r}

print(MData.2)
